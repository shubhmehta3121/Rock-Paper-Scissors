# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This Python script creates a simple interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game that utilizes hand gestures detected by a webcam. The game allows the player to compete against a computer opponent. It provides a user-friendly interface, real-time gesture recognition, and displays game results on the screen.

**Key Features:**

1. **Hand Gesture Recognition:** The script uses a webcam to detect the player's hand gestures within a designated area on the screen.

2. **Gameplay:** The player makes hand gestures representing "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" (with their palm facing the screen), while the computer randomly selects a gesture.

3. **Result Display:** After the player makes a gesture, the script determines the winner of the round and displays the result on the screen.

4. **Game Statistics:** Players can check their game statistics by making a "Thumbs Up" gesture.

5. **Restart Option:** The game can be restarted at any time.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:** The script provides clear instructions and visual cues to guide the player.

**How to Use:**

- Clone the repository and install the required libraries.
- Run the `Step 5 New.py` script.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game and make hand gestures to select "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate gesture-based interaction with a computer using computer vision techniques. It offers an engaging and interactive way to play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
